This is the repo of the course project of SJTU 2024 fall brain-inspired intelligence.

This model is a modification of MambaOut model, modified form the implementation of MambaOut proposed by the paper "[MambaOut: Do We Really Need Mamba for Vision?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07992)". 

# Requirements

```
astor
sortedcontainers
torch (with cuda)
sympy
spikingjelly
```

# Run 
## SMO, XSMO

1. Make sure your `nvcc` version is compatible with PyTorch. If you use CUDA 12.1 with x86-64 Linux, you can use my compiled binary, in `build_mambaout`. Otherwise, compilation will start automatically,  repoting a runtime error if versions are incompatible.
2. See `val.sh`, modify the three arguments at top. Checkpoint file name should match model name.
3. `bash val.sh` and wait. You should see results in a minute.

## Explorations
```bash
python explorations/train.py <act_name>
```
act_name is either `gelu`, `srelu` or `seplu`. You should modify `DATASET_PATH` to fit your path.
